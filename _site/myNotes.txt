to do: replace challenge 1 with a more general example


i don't like violin plot example -- doesn't reveal a bi-modal distribution 


We can also specify the colors directly inside the mapping provided in the `ggplot()` function. This will be seen by any geom layers and the mapping will be determined by the x- and y-axis set up in `aes()`.

```{r color-by-species-2, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length, color = species_id)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```


ratio of foot length to weight by species -- does this change over time?

change species to genus throughout?


plots work but are pretty boring
